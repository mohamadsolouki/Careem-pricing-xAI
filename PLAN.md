## Project Overview

**Research Title:**  
*XPrice: An Explainable AI Framework for Transparent Dynamic Pricing in Urban Ride-Hailing — A Dubai Case Study*

**Core Idea:**  
Careem's surge pricing is a black-box ML system. Riders don't know why their fare is AED 42 vs AED 18. Operations managers can't interrogate why prices spiked. This project proposes and demonstrates an XAI layer that makes every pricing decision transparent for both internal operators and end-users. We construct a high-fidelity synthetic mirror dataset of Dubai ride-hailing operations, train a coordinate-first XGBoost fare model, export tree contribution values for local and global explanations, and deliver a live interactive application that simulates a real request-a-ride experience with map-selected pickup and dropoff points.

**Research Methodology:** Design Science Research (DSR) — Peffers et al. (2007)  
Six phases: Problem Identification → Objectives → Design & Development → Demonstration → Evaluation → Communication (the paper).

**Data Strategy:**  
We construct a synthetic mirror dataset modeled on Dubai's real ride-hailing operational patterns using public knowledge and open tools (Careem Engineering Blog, e& reports, WTW 2024 MENA report, OpenWeatherMap historical data, Dubai events calendar, OSRM routing, optional TomTom traffic flow). The paper explicitly states this is a researcher-constructed mirror dataset used to demonstrate the proposed XAI methodology rather than proprietary Careem data.

## Project Phases & Step-by-Step Plan

---

### PHASE 1 — Dataset Construction
**Goal:** Build a rich, realistic Dubai ride-hailing dataset (165,000 records, 68 columns) centered on exact pickup and dropoff coordinates rather than only neighborhood labels.

#### 1.1 Define Feature Set

**Spatial features (Dubai geography):**
- `pickup_lat` / `pickup_lon` / `dropoff_lat` / `dropoff_lon` — realistic coordinates per zone, jittered to simulate exact rider endpoints
- `pickup_zone` / `dropoff_zone` — derived metadata labels for the nearest research zone centroid
- `route_direct_distance_km` — direct great-circle distance between the two endpoints
- `route_distance_km` — routed trip distance with OSRM-style geometry or a deterministic fallback
- `route_efficiency_ratio` — routed distance divided by direct distance
- `route_bearing_deg` — bearing from pickup to dropoff for directional patterns
- `is_airport_ride` — binary flag (DXB pickup or dropoff)
- `pickup_density_score` / `dropoff_density_score` — density multipliers derived from the zone profile

**Temporal features:**
- `timestamp` — full datetime across Jan–Dec 2025
- `hour` — 0–23
- `day_of_week` — 0–6 (Fri/Sat = UAE weekend)
- `is_weekend` — binary (Fri/Sat in UAE)
- `month` — 1–12
- `is_ramadan` — binary (Ramadan 2025: 1–29 March)
- `is_uae_public_holiday` — New Year, Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, UAE National Day (2–3 Dec), Islamic New Year, Prophet's Birthday
- `is_peak_hour` — 07:00–09:00 and 17:00–20:00
- `is_late_night` — 00:00–04:00

**Event features (Dubai 2025):**
- `active_event` — None / DSF (Dubai Shopping Festival, Jan–Feb) / GITEX (Oct) / Dubai Airshow (Nov) / NYE Burj / Eid / F1 Weekend / Concert / Sports
- `event_proximity_km` — distance of pickup to nearest active event venue
- `event_demand_multiplier` — estimated demand boost (1.0–2.5x)

**Weather features (Dubai-specific):**
- `temperature_c` — realistic Dubai temps (18°C Jan – 42°C Jul)
- `humidity_pct` — Dubai humidity profile
- `is_rain` — rare but causes large surge (Dubai averages 8 rain days/year)
- `is_sandstorm` — binary (reduces visibility, boosts ride demand)
- `weather_demand_factor` — composite weather impact on demand

**Supply features:**
- `product_type` — Comfort / Executive / Premier / MAX / Kids / Electric / Hala Taxi / Hala Max
- `payment_method` — Credit Card / Cash / Careem Pay / Careem Plus
- `demand_index` — composite demand score combining density, weather, events, and time windows
- `captain_availability_score` — bounded supply proxy from 0.15 to 1.00
- `supply_pressure_index` — inverse of availability
- `traffic_index` — route-specific congestion proxy or live-flow feature when available

**Pricing features (target construction):**
- `booking_fee_aed` — booking fee by product and time band
- `metered_fare_aed` — pre-final fare from the pricing logic
- `surge_multiplier` — calculated from demand and supply pressure for private-hire products
- `final_price_aed` — target variable, inclusive of route, time, toll, and congestion effects
- `price_per_km_aed` — derived final fare per routed kilometer

**Outcome features:**
- `booking_status` — Completed / Captain Cancelled / Customer Cancelled / No Captain
- `wait_time_minutes` — VTAT
- `captain_rating` / `customer_rating`

#### 1.2 Pricing Formula
```
final_price = (base_fare + per_km_rate × distance) × surge_multiplier × weather_factor × event_factor
surge_multiplier = 1.0 + demand_supply_gap × 0.4  (capped at 2.5)
demand_supply_gap = (ride_requests_zone_hour / avg_requests_zone_hour) - (captains_available / avg_captains)
```

#### 1.3 Deliverable
- File: `data/processed/dubai_rides_2025.csv` (165k rows, 68 columns)
- Script: `data/generate_dataset.py`
- Documentation: `data/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`

---

### PHASE 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Goal:** Understand the dataset, validate it mirrors real Dubai patterns, generate descriptive insights for the paper.

Key analyses:
- Price distribution by zone, product, hour, weather condition
- Surge multiplier heatmap by hour × day
- Event impact on price (before/during/after)
- Ramadan vs non-Ramadan comparison
- Rain days: price spike analysis
- Feature correlation matrix

Deliverable: `notebooks/02_eda.ipynb` + key figures saved to `docs/figures/`

---

### PHASE 3 — ML Price Prediction Model
**Goal:** Train a model that predicts `final_price_aed` with high accuracy, compatible with SHAP.

**Models to train:**
1. XGBoost (primary — best SHAP compatibility, high accuracy)
2. LightGBM (comparison)
3. Random Forest (baseline)

**Evaluation metrics:** RMSE, MAE, R², feature importance

**Why XGBoost:** Boosted trees deliver top accuracy on the mirror dataset and support stable per-feature contribution exports through native `pred_contribs` inference in this environment, which avoids compatibility issues seen with direct `shap.TreeExplainer` usage on the current XGBoost build.

**Feature engineering:**
- Keep lat/lon, direct distance, routed distance, route efficiency, bearing, density scores, and traffic index as core numeric features
- One-hot encode product, payment, event type, and area type metadata rather than the raw zone names
- Cyclical encoding: hour (sin/cos), day of week (sin/cos), month (sin/cos)
- Interaction features: peak × traffic, demand × traffic, efficiency × traffic, bearing sin/cos, and coordinate deltas

**Train/test split:** 80/20 stratified by month (to test generalization across seasons)

Deliverables:
- `models/train_model.py`
- `models/saved/xgboost_price_model.pkl`
- `notebooks/03_model_training.ipynb`

---

### PHASE 4 — XAI Layer (SHAP Analysis)
**Goal:** Generate SHAP-style global and local explanations from the trained XGBoost model using native tree contribution outputs.

#### 4.1 Global Explanations (Operations Manager view)
- **SHAP summary beeswarm plot** — which features globally drive price variation
- **SHAP bar chart** — mean absolute SHAP values (ranked feature importance)
- **SHAP dependence plots** — how `route_distance_km`, `traffic_index`, `demand_index`, `temperature_c`, and `event_demand_multiplier` interact with price
- **SHAP heatmap** — feature impact across time of day, product, and derived zone metadata

#### 4.2 Local Explanations (Individual ride — End-User view)
- **SHAP waterfall plot** — for a single ride: base price → contribution of each feature → final price
  - e.g., "Base: AED 12.00 | +AED 8.20 (route distance 14km) | +AED 4.10 (trade-show demand) | +AED 2.80 (traffic congestion) | +AED 1.50 (peak hour) | = AED 28.60"
- **SHAP force plot** — interactive version of waterfall
- **Natural language explanation generator** — converts SHAP values into plain English sentences for the user-facing app

#### 4.3 LIME Comparison
Apply LIME to the same predictions as a methodological comparison — discuss differences in consistency, stability, computational cost.

Deliverables:
- `models/xai_analysis.py`
- `notebooks/04_xai_analysis.ipynb`
- Figures saved to `docs/figures/shap/`

## Key Design Decisions & Rationale

**Why XGBoost over neural networks?**  
SHAP's TreeExplainer gives exact Shapley values for tree-based models in O(TLD²) time. Neural network explanations via KernelExplainer are approximate and 100x slower. For a demonstration that needs to run in real-time in a web app, XGBoost is the right choice.

**Why a mirror dataset rather than real data?**  
Careem's operational data is proprietary. Our synthetic dataset is constructed using publicly documented operational parameters (Careem Engineering Blog, e& FY2025 report, WTW 2024 MENA ride-hailing report) to produce a statistically plausible representation. This is explicitly disclosed in the paper's methodology section. Using a researcher-constructed dataset to demonstrate a proposed framework is a recognized approach in Design Science Research (Peffers et al., 2007).

**Why dual-audience (internal + external)?**  
Existing XAI literature focuses almost exclusively on model developers and regulators. The contribution of explaining pricing to end-users in plain language at the point of booking is novel, especially in the MENA context where algorithmic transparency is an emerging regulatory concern.

**Why Dubai only?**  
Dubai provides the richest operational context: diverse zone types (airport, tourist, commercial, residential), the full event calendar (DSF, GITEX, NYE at Burj), and UAE-specific factors (Ramadan, Friday/Saturday weekend). Limiting to one city allows deeper, more realistic feature engineering than spreading thinly across five cities.
